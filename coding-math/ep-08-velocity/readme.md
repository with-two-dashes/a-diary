# Velocity

"It is easy to associate Velocity with Speed, but speed is only one aspect of velocity."

`Speed` says This thig is moving X fast!
`Velocity` says This thing is moving X fast AND in THAT direction!

- A Velocity
  - has `speed` or `magnitude`
    - has `distance` and `time`
      - `distance` is the value
      - `time` is the unit
        - for our purposes, this will be `Pixels Per Frame`
        - later, we will learn how to do `Pixels Per Second`
  - has `heading` or `direction` or `angle`
